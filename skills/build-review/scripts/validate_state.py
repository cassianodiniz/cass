"""
validate_state.py - deterministic completion gate for a feature.

The skill's strongest invariant is "the Verifier is always-on, never prompted;
Execute is not done until validation.md reports PASS." That is prose the model
must remember. This turns it into a checkable pass/fail the closing step runs
automatically, so declaring a feature done without a real Verifier report fails
loudly instead of slipping through.

It does NOT merely check that validation.md exists - a report that exists but is
empty, still holds the template placeholder, or has no evidence would pass a
shallow existence check while proving nothing. This gate requires a real,
filled verdict plus at least one file:line evidence citation.

Operates only on the .specs/ markdown artifacts (stack- and tool-agnostic). No
dependencies. Run from the project root (the dir that contains .specs), or pass
--root. Meant to be invoked by the skill as the closing gate of Execute, the
same way lessons.py is invoked at distillation - not a manual step.

Usage:
  python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/validate_state.py [feature]
  python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/validate_state.py

  Invoke from the skill directory that ships this script (not the project root).
  Pass --root when cwd is not the project that contains .specs/.

Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 a completed feature is missing a real PASS report,
            2 usage error.
